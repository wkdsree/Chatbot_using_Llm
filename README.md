# Chatbot_using_Llm
This project is a chatbot built using Large Language Models (LLMs). It processes documents using pypdf, generates vector embeddings and tokens, and then trains a model using the OpenAI API or Mistral API. The chatbot is deployed using a Gradio interface and containerized with Docker for easy deployment.
